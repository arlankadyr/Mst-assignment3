**Implemented Algorithms:** Prim's and Kruskal's for MST  
**Bonus Implemented:** Custom Graph and Edge classes (+10%)

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to apply Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms to optimize a city's transportation network by determining the minimum set of roads that connect all city districts with the lowest possible total construction cost. The implementation also analyzes the efficiency of both algorithms and compares their performance in terms of execution time and operation count.

## Task Description

The city administration plans to construct roads connecting all districts in such a way that:
- Each district is reachable from any other district.
- The total cost of construction is minimized.

This scenario is modeled as a weighted undirected graph, where:
- Vertices represent city districts.
- Edges represent potential roads.
- Edge weights represent the cost of constructing the road.

## Assignment Requirements

1. **Input Data:** Read transportation network data from JSON files and create custom datasets based on the example.
2. **Implementations:** Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
3. **Metrics Recorded for Each Algorithm:**
   - List of edges forming the MST.
   - Total cost of the MST.
   - Number of vertices and edges in the original graph.
   - Number of operations performed (e.g., comparisons, unions).
   - Execution time in milliseconds.

4. **Comparison:** The MST total cost must be identical for both algorithms, though the tree structure may differ.

## Input Datasets

Generated multiple datasets with varying graph sizes and densities:

| Dataset              | Vertices | Edges | Purpose                  |
|----------------------|----------|-------|--------------------------|
| `input_small.json`   | 5        | 7     | Correctness and debugging |
| `input_medium.json`  | 10       | 14    | Performance observation   |
| `input_large.json`   | 25       | 80    | Scalability testing      |

Each dataset is stored in `src/main/resources/` as JSON files.

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Tests (JUnit 5)
Included in `src/test/java/MstTest.java`. Tests verify:

**Correctness Tests:**
- Total MST cost is identical for both algorithms.
- Number of edges in MST equals V - 1.
- MST contains no cycles (acyclic).
- MST connects all vertices (single connected component).
- Disconnected graphs handled gracefully (no MST or indication).

**Performance and Consistency Tests:**
- Execution time is non-negative and measured in ms.
- Operation counts are non-negative and consistent.
- Results are reproducible for the same dataset.

Run tests with: `mvn test`

### Output and Evaluation
Results are recorded in JSON files (e.g., `results/output.json`) and summarized in a CSV for comparison.

## Comparison Between Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms

### Theory
- **Prim's Algorithm:** Builds MST by growing a single tree from a starting vertex. Time complexity: O(E log V) using binary heap. Best for dense graphs (E ≈ V²) where adjacency lists provide locality.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm:** Sorts all edges and adds the smallest without cycles using Union-Find. Time complexity: O(E log E). Best for sparse graphs (E ≈ V) due to efficient sorting and early termination after V-1 edges.
- **Efficiency Factors:** Graph density (sparse vs. dense), edge representation (list vs. matrix), implementation complexity (Union-Find optimizations like path compression and union-by-rank make Kruskal nearly O(E α(V))).

### In Practice
- **Small Graphs (4-6 vertices):** Kruskal is slightly faster (1.28 ms vs. 1.52 ms) due to fewer operations (37 vs. 42).
- **Medium Graphs (10-15 vertices):** Similar performance, but Kruskal edges out (1.89 ms vs. 2.10 ms) on sparse networks.
- **Large Graphs (20-30+ vertices):** Kruskal scales better (7.91 ms vs. 8.74 ms) for sparse road networks; Prim would excel in dense urban scenarios.
- **Operation Count:** Kruskal consistently lower due to Union-Find efficiency.
- **Memory:** Prim uses O(V) for keys/parents; Kruskal O(E) for sorting.
- **Reproducibility:** Results identical across runs.

Both algorithms produce correct MSTs with identical costs, confirming implementation validity.

## Conclusions

- **Preferable Algorithm:** Use **Kruskal's** for real-world sparse transportation networks (e.g., rural roads, E ≈ V log V) due to faster execution and lower operations. Use **Prim's** for dense graphs (e.g., city grids) or when adjacency matrix is available.
- **Conditions:** Graph density is key—Kruskal for low density (< 0.1), Prim for high. Implementation: Kruskal simpler for edge-list inputs.
- **Overall:** Both are efficient for V ≤ 30; for larger, consider optimizations like Fibonacci heaps for Prim.
